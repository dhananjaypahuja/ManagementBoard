# ManagementBoard

## Getting Started
Main.java is incomplete, but is intended to be the driver class for the application.

Compile from the root directory `ManagementBoard` with `javac -d ./bin -sourcepath .:./src ./src/controller/Main.java`. Run with `java -cp ./bin/ controller.Main`. You may have to create the `bin` directory.
